title: [JS30] - Clock

Given the Javascript 30 days challenges [HERE](https://javascript30.com)

I will post my fiddling here with individual posts haha :)

Starting with the javascript (steam)clock in the link below!

[STEAM?CLOCK](/js-thirty/day2-clock)

This particular challenge isn't too challenging, the trick is that css transform tends to snap back,
if you revert the degree. I fixed it with a hack, to omit the animation on that last tick to the origin.
